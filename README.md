# Hackathon
Owner-Chandresh paswan collaborators-Basukkinath thakur,Shubham Tiwari
Team Name-Navi Team
Approach to problem-solving-
Algorithms/process/control flow
Data structures
Relationships
Components (how do we break this problem down)
we find that by doing this, it's easier to visualize as we start coding. we also will spot flaws before I start into the code because we can see everything in front of us (instead of incessant scrolling and window-hopping). Not only that, once it's written out we can let things form in the back of my mind as we are working on other tasks. we can also work in a non-linear fashion, committing an idea to paper when it hits us and then come back to it when we reach the point where we need it.
Algorithm- 1-file is insert by user
2-fetch file from directory
3-Remove Whitespaces and Curly Braces
4-Break into words
5-Compare with set of Keywords
6-Maximum Count of keywords for any language is preferd
Implementation- We are using some striking features of collection from java,for frontend html is used and Backend is used Servlet ,Advanced java,Core java to deploy project we used github.Waterfall model approach is used
Data structure-Divide and Conquer we used Merge Sort approach on Data and compare them ,Count them
Running Instructions-
 O/S : Windows xp
 Language : Java (jdk1.6.0)
 Front End : HTML
 Back End :Servlet java
 IDE :My eclipse 
Future Prospects-we are enhance much easier and simple technique to handle such problem
